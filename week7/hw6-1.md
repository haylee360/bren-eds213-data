# Little Bobby Tales
Author: Haylee Oyler

### Part 1
His name can cause catastrophe because the `')` closes the string name for robert, and then you have a new command `DROP TABLE Students;--`. The `--` comments out the rest of the line, which effectively means after you select the name robert, the next command that gets run is drop the entire students table. 

### Part 2
If you changed the query, bobby could still code something like
```{SQL}
Robert`; DROP TABLE Students;--
```

### Bonus Problem
The malicious user could make this their species code where it would both insert into the database the species code `wolv`, but also add Taylor Swift to the list of personnel.
```{SQL}
wolv'; INSERT INTO Personnel (name) VALUES ('Taylor Swift');--
```
