This dataset is hosted by the [NSF Arctic Data Center](https://arcticdata.io). Complete metadata for can be found at `01_ASDN_Readme.txt` provided in the [EDS 213 course repository](https://github.com/UCSB-Library-Research-Data-Services/bren-meds213-spring-2024-class-data/week1).

## Data and File Overview

### 1. File List

- `all_cover_fixed_hayleeoyler.csv`: contains the cleaned land cover type data. This includes percentages of snow cover, land cover, water cover, and total cover for the arctic shorebirds habitats. This is the cleaned version of the data originally found in `ASDN_Snow_Survey.csv`

### 2. Relationship Between Files

### 3. Additional related data collected that was not included in the current data package

### 4. Are there multiple versions of the dataset?
