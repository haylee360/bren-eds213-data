# Homework 5-1 Protect Yourself
Haylee Oyler

Some strategies were mentioned in class for reducing the possibility of performing UPDATEs and DELETEs that have catastrophic consequences. What strategy will you use?

I like the strategy of using `SELECT` first before doing an `UPDATE` or `DELETE`
For example:

```{sql}
-- doing a SELECT first
SELECT * FROM Bird_eggs WHERE Nest_ID LIKE 'z%';

-- Then perform the delete
DELETE * FROM Bird_eggs WHERE Nest_ID LIKE 'z%';

```
