# Ten bash essentials
Haylee Oyler

1. These three commands all give the same output (listing the files in the directory ASDN_csv). The first command lists files where you are, the `.` also refers to your current directory, and `"$(pwd)/../ASDN_csv" also changes dir up one, and back into ASDN_csv. 

2. You get only one number because you've concatenated all files ending in `.csv` and then piped to line count, so you're getting the total line count of all the files ending in `.csv`

3. Because you've put a file name after -l, this means the `wc -l` is only looking at species.csv, not the `cat *.csv` from before the pipe. You could fix this by moving `cat *.csv` after `species.csv`

4. echo "$name"_Howard

5. Variable `$1` is the first file ending in `.csv`, which is `ASDN_Snow_survey.csv`.  Variable `$#` is the last file ending in `.csv`, which is `species.csv`. 

6. The value of variable `$3` would be the second value inside the date output. Judging by the date output from earlier in the tutorial, it seems to be the month. So this would likely output May. 

7. This would give you an empty file because the destructive overwrite of `>` happens before the sort, so now the sort is happening on an empty list. Instead, you could do something like:
```{bash}
`sort junk_file.txt > sorted_tmp.txt`
`mv sorted_tmp.txt junk_file.txt`
```

8. If you accidentally put a space between the wildcard and the `.csv`, then bash would think `.csv` is an actual file name to be removed, not just an ending of a filename/s.
